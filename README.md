# Centerline and polygon data for the Trinity River, Texas
This repository houses the datasets generated and analyzed in "Measuring and modeling the spatiotemporal impact of meander bend cutoffs on local and nonlocal migration patterns and rates: Examples from the Trinity River, Texas", by C. Speed, Z. Sylvester, P. Morris, and D. Mohrig. Datasets include shapefiles representing centerline positions for each year (1985-2022) and corresponding bar polygons which contain attributes reflecting spatiotemporal changes in bend geometry and kinematics. Please contact the corresponding author C. Speed (cole.speed@beg.utexas.edu) with any questions regarding these datasets and/or analyses.
