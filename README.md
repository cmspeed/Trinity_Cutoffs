# Curvature-driven planform dynamics for cutoff bends along the Trinity River, TX 
This repository contains code used to generate and analyze data for **The impact of post-cutoff curvature on channel kinematics in meandering rivers: An example from the Trinity River, Texas, USA** by C. Speed, Z. Sylvester, P. Morris, and D. Mohrig. Due to Github file size constraints, corresponding data generated as part of this study can be found [here](URL). Available datasets include (1)comma separated value (csv) files and ESRI shapefiles representing Landsat-derived centerline and bankline positions from the lower Trinity River, TX over a 37-year period (1985-2022); (2) a series of directed graphs containing attributes reflecting spatiotemporal changes in bend geometry and kinematics; (3) Landsat Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) scenes and binary channel centerline rasters; and (4) river discharge data acquired at USGS 08066500. Please contact the corresponding author C. Speed (cole.speed@beg.utexas.edu) with any questions regarding these datasets and/or analyses.
