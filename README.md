# Quantifying post-cutoff planform dynamics of bends along the Trinity River, TX from 37 years of Landsat 
This repository contains data and analyzed in **The impact of post-cutoff curvature on channel kinematics in meandering rivers: An example from the Trinity River, Texas, USA** by C. Speed, Z. Sylvester, P. Morris, and D. Mohrig. Source code may be found [here](https://github.com/zsylvester/meandergraph). Datasets include (1) comma separated value (csv) files and ESRI shapefiles representing Landsat-derived centerline positions from the lower Trinity River, TX over a 37-year period (1985-2022); (2) a series of directed graphs containing attributes reflecting spatiotemporal changes in bend geometry and kinematics; and (3) directed graphs for two synthetic models (Model A and Model B) and a model of the Trinity River. Please contact the corresponding author C. Speed (cole.speed@beg.utexas.edu) with any questions regarding these datasets and/or analyses. A preprint of the accepted manuscript is available [here][Preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/69ctful6vbjnw6muy0ezm/Speed_etal_2023_preprint.pdf?rlkey=lj0db0xbpomxdxevldxk092y0&dl=0) with journal permission under an Open Access license agreement.
